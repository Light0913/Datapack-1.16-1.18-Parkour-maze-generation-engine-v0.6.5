# [Data package] [1.16-1.18+] Parkour maze generation engine v0.6.5 -- intelligent generation of Parkour maze!
We have a method to generate parkour with algorithm and maze with algorithm.

(In fact, it is a "parkour maze", which is essentially a maze, but the route is parkour line - the maze is professional, parkour only stays in the "box" at present, but it is also very awesome.)

——If it is not in the MC, the algorithm outside can only generate the maze of ordinary lines (two-dimensional or three-dimensional), but because Steve in adventure mode can't fly, so - Parkour!

Maybe if you want to add some maze elements to your map, you might as well try this one. You can easily build a parkour maze with a few instructions~

## Version:

Minecraft for [1.16-1.18+].

## Version log:

[0.6.3] Solved the problem that the new world could not use data packets normally (solved an infinite self-iteration of goal_set)

[0.6.4] Solved the problem that survival or adventure mode did not score when it reached the scoring point (I don't know where hand sliding changed the command)

[0.6.5] solves the problem that the execute positioned method cannot modify the actual starting point position (remove "at @ s" in "start")
