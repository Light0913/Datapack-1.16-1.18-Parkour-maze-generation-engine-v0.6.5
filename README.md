# [Data package] [1.16-1.18+] Parkour maze generation engine v0.6.5 -- intelligent generation of Parkour maze!
We have a method to generate parkour with algorithm and maze with algorithm.

(In fact, it is a "parkour maze", which is essentially a maze, but the route is parkour line - the maze is professional, parkour only stays in the "box" at present, but it is also very awesome.)

——If it is not in the MC, the algorithm outside can only generate the maze of ordinary lines (two-dimensional or three-dimensional), but because Steve in adventure mode can't fly, so - Parkour!

Maybe if you want to add some maze elements to your map, you might as well try this one. You can easily build a parkour maze with a few instructions~
